At the time of writing, this is the **only** Discord bot written in [Callisto](https://callisto.mesyeti.uk/), which also makes it the **best** Discord bot written in Callisto. There is also a not-insignificant chance this is the only Discord bot powered by [CGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface) - I haven't found evidence of others yet, but feel free to open an issue if you find one.
